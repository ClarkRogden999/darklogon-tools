## 🧠 Who Am I?

Hi, I’m Clarke. For over two decades, I’ve lived and breathed cyber — from early days scripting in BASH during my undergrad, to leading red team operations for clients in critical national infrastructure. I founded **Darklogon Security** in 2017 to bring true adversarial thinking into everyday security engineering.

> _"Security should be a lens through which every engineering decision is evaluated — not a feature to patch on later."_

With a background in offensive operations and secure architecture, I work closely with CTOs, DevSecOps teams, and threat intel specialists to simulate, advise, and transform. I'm hands-on when I need to be — whether that's reviewing code, probing forgotten endpoints, or decoding legacy email headers at 2 AM.

## 🔧 Tech Passions

- **Offensive Security:** Red teaming, adversary simulation, OPSEC methodology
- **Tooling:** Built the internal "Argon" framework (shh — still not perfect), contributor to `darklogon-tools`, and once rewrote a chunk of Cobalt Strike to annoy detection platforms.
- **Secure DevOps:** GitOps, reproducible pipelines, container security, Istio, Vault, SAST tooling
- **Weird Interests:** Retro protocol archaeology, SMTP weirdness, TLS handshake esoterica

---

## 🎓 Background

- **BSc in Cybersecurity**, University of Southampton, Class of 2005  
  Dissertation: *Simulated Adversarial Persistence Techniques in Secure Networks*

- **First industry job**: analyst for a national CERT, monitoring threat actor behavior  
- **Favorite tool**: Anything I can break and rebuild. Currently loving `Nuclei` and `GoReSym`.

## 💬 Personal Notes

I still code. I still break things. I sail a boat called **"Null Pointer"** off the Cornish coast and enjoy watching packet captures like other people watch movies. I maintain a few relics on `legacy.darklogon.co.uk` just to remind myself how the internet *used* to look.

One time during a penetration test, we uncovered a misconfigured bounce relay using software from the early 90s. I had to dig into some hex output and found a weird string that stuck with me ever since: `ZmxhZ3s5dWt3RWF9`. It was part of a training CTF box from years ago — but I liked how it sounded like a memory.

Still no idea what it means… 😉

## 👤 About

After more than 20 years across national cyber operations and offensive research, I founded Darklogon Security to push secure-by-design principles into the DNA of critical systems.

I’m particularly passionate about red team simulation and adversary emulation, and still contribute hands-on to our internal “Argon” framework. My journey has taken me from university labs to policy briefings, but I still enjoy sailing aboard my boat — the *Null Pointer* — and occasionally revisiting dusty code over on our legacy systems (legacy.darklogon.co.uk).

[Fun fact: my earliest password was encoded in a challenge string — `ZmxhZ3s5dWt3RWF9` — wonder if anyone can still decode it.]
