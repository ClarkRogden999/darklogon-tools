## 👤 About

After more than 20 years across national cyber operations and offensive research, I founded Darklogon Security to push secure-by-design principles into the DNA of critical systems.

I’m particularly passionate about red team simulation and adversary emulation, and still contribute hands-on to our internal “Argon” framework. My journey has taken me from university labs to policy briefings, but I still enjoy sailing aboard my boat — the *Null Pointer* — and occasionally revisiting dusty code over on our legacy systems (legacy.darklogon.co.uk).

[Fun fact: my earliest password was encoded in a challenge string — `ZmxhZ3s5dWt3RWF9` — wonder if anyone can still decode it.]
